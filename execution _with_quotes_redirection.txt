2>&1

curl www.goooooooooooooooogle.com > check.txt 2>&1
The 1 denotes standard output (stdout). The 2 denotes standard error (stderr).

So 2>&1 says to send standard error to where ever standard output is being redirected as well. Which since it's being sent to check.txt 

cmd > log.txt

it will create empty file log.txt and execute with error 
"Command 'cmd' not found, but there are 19 similar ones."

pwd > log.txt 

it will redirect output of pwd commant into log.txt file

cmd 2> log.txt

this command will redirect output of the error "Command 'cmd' not found, but there are 19 similar ones."
into log.txt file 

export first_word=HELLO
export second_word=WORLD

echo "$first_word $second_word"
it will print variables: HELLO WORLD 

echo '$first_word $second_word'
it will print the names of the variables $first_word $second_word, print it "as is"

echo `$first_word $second_word`
it will try to execute command in "``" but we will have error: HELLO: command not found

echo "\$first_word \$second_word"
it will print names of the variables : $first_word $second_word

“No Space Left on Device” Error
1. check disk space 
sudo df -h

if disk space is enough, but you see error, reasons:
Recently Deleted File - Often a file is deleted while a process is still using it, 
keeping the space reserved even though the file is already gone.
fix: Restart Processes Using Deleted Files
sudo lsof / | grep deleted 
sudo systemctl restart service_name
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  #If there are multiple processes or you just don’t want to bother with finding specific services

Not Enough Inodes - Inodes are the index pages of a Unix filesystem, holding the metadata of every file on storage.
However, inodes aren’t unlimited, and running out of inodes before the storage space can give you the  error.
Fix: check inodes
sudo df -i 
#All you can do is delete any unnecessary files to free up inodes for future files.

Failing Hard Drive - Then of course there is the possibility that the hard drive is simply failing,
and much of the apparent free space is taken up by bad sectors. 
Since the system fails to write any files to these locations, it throws an error.
fix: mark the bad sectors so that they are no longer referenced by the file system.
Doing this requires you to boot from a Live CD, as you cannot perform a File System Check within a running drive. 
Once you do that, just use the following command:
sudo fsck -vcck /dev/sda
